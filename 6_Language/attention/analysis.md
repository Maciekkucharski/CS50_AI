## Layer 4, Head 6

In case if this head we can see an interesting behaviour. In most cases the head is paying attenation to one predecessor, but in case where before the word there is a combination of a preposition and determiner or verb and determiner the head is paying attention to two words before instead of one. It is mostlikely because word "the" doesnt mean anything by itself.

Example Sentences:
- i think that  [MASK] is the most beautifull thing in the world
